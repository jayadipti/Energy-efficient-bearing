This model is a part of bearing failure prediction system using AI/ML.
It collects real-time sensor data and predicts failure risk using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model.
The watchdog mechanism ensures the script continues running without issues.
If the failure risk is high, the system may trigger alerts or take preventive actions.
